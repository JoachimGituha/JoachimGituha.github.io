            <h3>My Professional Experiences:</h3>
            <p>Despite my young age, I have had the opportunity to gain several experiences in the working world.</p>    
            <p>During my internship in 9th grade, I got my first glimpse of the working world. Indeed, I was able to work for a week at a winemaker in Mittelbergheim at the Rieffel André and Lucas estate. This first discovery of the professional world allowed me to understand the difficulties one sometimes faces and the motivation required to properly maintain the vines.</p>
            <p>I then worked as a volunteer for the UTMB during the Alsace trail.</p>
            <p>Finally, I worked in July 2024 again at a winemaker. At the Domaine du Vieux Pressoir - SCHLOSSER. This job represents my first real experience as an employee. I discovered almost all facets of the winemaker's profession, from working with grapes and vines to labeling, boxing, and selling, as well as bottling, fermentation, and disgorgement.</p>
            <p>This job not only allowed me to discover the working world, but I also learned how to work as an employee with my boss. I made friends with whom I learned to work as a team and shared many moments.</p>
